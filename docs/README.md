# adfree DNS

We run a public privacy-protecting DNS server with advertising, tracker, and malware filtering. The Usable Privacy DNS (updns) service is accessible via the encrypted [DoH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS\_over\_HTTPS) and [DoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS\_over\_TLS) protocols. We use the unified hosts from [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack) to filter unwanted domains.

## How to use the Usable Privacy DNS Services

{% content-ref url="updns-services/dns-over-https-doh/" %}
[dns-over-https-doh](updns-services/dns-over-https-doh/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="updns-services/dot-dns-over-tls.md" %}
[dot-dns-over-tls.md](updns-services/dot-dns-over-tls.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Privacy Policy

1. We do not log client IPs, requested domains or any other personally-identifiable information.
2. We aggregate information on filtered domains and geolocation for user protection.
