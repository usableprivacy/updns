## Recommended Additional Intra Settings

### **Verify advertising and tracker domains are filtered**

The updns service responds with `0.0.0.0` for filtered domains.

In the following screenshot you see that Snapchat App Analytics is blocked by the updns DoH server.

### Recommended whitelist settings for Intra on Android

Our adfree DoH server works best against tracking by mobile apps. DNS-based blocking is very coarse-grained. We therefore recommend you use browsers with blocking extensions and use our DNS service primarily to **counter mobile app tracking**. You can exclude e.g. your mobile browser from Intra:
